review/summary: The absolute best - taste better than brown sugar
review/text: I recently bought this sugar alternative and I am completely blown away! I have fibromyalgia, multiple food allergies/sensitivities and so many thing make me feel bad including exacerbating my pain. This does not have any negative effects on me whatsoever. The taste is out of this world! I am tempted to just eat it. This one is a winner! A little secret - I found it much cheaper at Whole Foods market.
